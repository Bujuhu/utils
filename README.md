# Utils

Just a collection of utility functions and boilerplate code I use from time to time.

I put all of them here in a single repo, because I don't like to add dependencies to my personal projects for work related stuff and I don't feel like this would be fleshed out enough to be published on package managers, I just copy-paste the functions I need into the projects I'm working on. Also creating a new repo for every language seems a bit overkill

But if you want to flesh this out and publish it for any language, feel free to fork this and do so
